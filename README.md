this client uses the [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) library to draw the screen as well as some components form [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib). there is a bug in blessed-contrib tree widget that was fixed in [this pr](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib/pull/68) but reverted.
